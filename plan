1. Problem Statement
The objective of a problem statement is to state the problem you are trying to solve clearly.

    1) Specific: The problem statement has to be detailed and specific to the problem you are solving.
        Collecting dataset for USD - YEN FX swap rate and predict the rate in the future using ML algorithm.
        Possibly LSTM but further research requires.

    2) Measurable: Are there any metrics you can track so that you can tell if it is successful at the end of the project?
        If the dataset is large enough to divide one for training and the other for back-testing then leave the later part of the
        dataset as a "answer sheet" to check how good my prediction is.
        If not, then need to wait for the data to be created and check.

    3) Action: What specific actions can you take to solve your problem?
        Need a sophisticated research for the suitable ML model for prediction. And make sure what I can IMPROVE from the last
        project, Tensorust and put that in accountable.(ARIMA)

    4) Relevant: There are multiple ways to solve a problem but focus on the most relevant method.

    5) Timebound: Have you added a time constraint to when your problem should be solved?
        Will finish this by Fall 2024. Before I apply for the grad school.
